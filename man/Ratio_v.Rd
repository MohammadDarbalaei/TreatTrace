\title{Calculate and Visualize Ratio of Tumor Volumes or Confluency}
\usage{
Ratio_v(
  model,
  sampled_elements,
  q_up = 0.975,
  q_lo = 0.025,
  control_group = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A list containing:
\itemize{
  \item `condition_v`: A vector of condition labels for each sample.
  \item `K`: The number of unique conditions.
  \item `n_sam`: The number of samples per condition.
}
The `model` object is generated from the GPI function.}

\item{sampled_elements}{A named list of sampled tumor volume or confluency data.
Names should correspond to the unique values in `condition_v`, and this data is typically
derived from the `PPC_V` function.}

\item{q_up}{Numeric. The upper quantile threshold for filtering extreme values (default = 0.975).}

\item{q_lo}{Numeric. The lower quantile threshold for filtering extreme values (default = 0.025).}

\item{control_group}{Character. The name of the control group. Defaults to the first unique
condition in `condition_v`.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  - `plot_ratio_v`: A ggplot object visualizing the log-transformed ratios of tumor volumes
    or confluency across treatment groups.
  - `li_sam_ratio_V`: A list of computed ratios of tumor volumes or confluency.
}
\description{
This function calculates the ratio of tumor volumes or confluency for different treatment groups
relative to a control group. The ratios are log-transformed and visualized using violin plots
to highlight the distribution across conditions.
}
\details{
The `sampled_elements` input is derived using a Bayesian approach, where tumor volumes are
modeled with a lognormal likelihood and confluency with a beta likelihood. These ratios
provide insights into relative differences in treatment effects.

\examples{
# Example usage
model <- list(condition_v = c("Control", "Treatment1", "Treatment2"), K = 3, n_sam = 100)
sampled_elements <- list(
  Control = rnorm(100, mean = 10),
  Treatment1 = rnorm(100, mean = 15),
  Treatment2 = rnorm(100, mean = 20)
)
result <- Ratio_v(model, sampled_elements, control_group = "Control")
print(result$plot_ratio_v)
