1. Separately barcoded cell lines (Pool I) were cultured in 10 cm dishes (EH).

2. Cells were removed from the dishes, counted and equally mixed. The mixed cell pool was subcutaneously injected in mice (EH+AG Bauer).

3. Three control mice were sacrificed after tumor foramtion, prior to treatment start (d0).

4. Upon tumor formation, the mice were treated daily with different compounds (AG Bauer + AG Grüner)
Compounds (=abbreviation used for samples) 
- control (treated with solvent) = ctr
- Imatinib = im
- Sunitinib = sun
- Trametinib = tram
- Imatinib+Trametinib = im/tram
- Sunitinib + Trametinib = sun/tram

5. Tumor volume of mice was measured using a digital caliper (AG Bauer).

6. Mice were sacrificed according to animal protocols (AG Bauer / Ag Grüner.

7. DNA Isolation from the harvested tumors, PCR Amplification of Barcode region and Addition of Illumina Multiplexing Sequence, Separation of PCR products on Agarose gel, DNA purification, Illumina Sequencing and Barcode Extraction using Python Scripts (JZ)
